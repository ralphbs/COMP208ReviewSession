                <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                <p>My name is Ralph! I'm a McGill Software Engineering student leaving to work full-time as a Software Engineer at Uber in San Francisco. I was a Teaching Assistant for Comp 208 for the past 2 years. When I joined McGill, I started
                as a civil engineering student who like most of you was not exposed to programming much. Being in that position, I understand the difficulties one encounters in his or her learning process of a "foreign" concept.</p>
                <p>As for my experience, I worked closely with Professor Friedman to prepare the exams for the course(Midterms and Finals). I have been giving weekly tutorials for the past 2 years. I know the course in and out and this year I decided to organize my first prep session to help you crack your exam!</p>
                <h2>What you need to do?</h2>
                <p>Get your brains and willingness to learn and leave the rest for me.</p>
                <h2>How much is it?</h2>
                <p>It is <b>40$</b> per student for 6 hours to be paid via Paypal.</p>
                <h2>What do you get in this package?</h2>
                <p>You will get a review booklet + You will ace your exam!</p>
